# HI-WISE

My goal is to make all the scripts, jupyter notebooks, and data, I wrote/used for my first PhD project (HI-WISE). The results and resulting WISE photometry database was published in [Parkash et al. 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...864...40P/abstract).

** WARNING- This repository is still under-construction. I am currently "cleaning" my scripts and adding comments to them so it is easy for the community to read. **

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
